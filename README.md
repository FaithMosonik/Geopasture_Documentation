# GeoPasture

## Maamuzi Sahihi, Ushirikiano wa Kudumu (Right Decisions, Lasting Collaboration)

GeoPasture is a mobile application designed to foster peaceful coexistence and sustainable resource management between Kenyan pastoralists and agriculturalists through technology-enabled collaboration.

## Problem Statement

Pastoralists and agriculturalists in Kenya face persistent conflicts over shared resources, particularly grazing land. These conflicts arise due to:

- **Competition for Scarce Resources**: Population growth and unpredictable weather patterns increase pressure on limited grazing land and water sources
- **Lack of Communication**: Limited channels between communities lead to misunderstandings and mistrust
- **Traditional Practices**: Long-standing grazing methods may not be sustainable under changing environmental conditions

Recent conflicts in Baringo (2021) and Laikipia (2021) counties have resulted in loss of life, displacement of families, and significant economic hardship, highlighting the urgent need for innovative solutions.

## Solution Overview

GeoPasture leverages mobile technology to address these challenges through:

### Real-time Information Sharing
- Up-to-date data on pasture availability
- Localized weather forecasts 
- GPS-based livestock tracking

### Collaborative Decision-Making Tools
- Direct messaging between users
- Community forums for discussion and knowledge sharing
- Marketplace for trading agricultural products and livestock

### Geofencing for Resource Management
- Virtual boundaries around designated grazing areas
- Automated alerts when livestock approach boundaries
- Dynamic boundary management based on community agreements

## Technical Implementation

GeoPasture integrates several technologies:

- **Data Acquisition**: Satellite imagery, ground sensors, weather APIs, GPS tracking, and user reports
- **Processing**: Algorithms for pasture quality assessment, weather forecasting, and movement pattern analysis
- **Mobile Platform**: React Native application optimized for low-bandwidth environments with offline functionality
- **Geofencing**: Polygon-based boundary definition with configurable alerts and time-based access rules
- **Communication**: Secure messaging, forums, and marketplace features

## Current Status

This repository contains the development version of GeoPasture. The project is currently in the development phase, with plans to conduct pilot programs in selected regions of Kenya.

## Impact & Vision

GeoPasture aims to transform resource management practices by:
- Reducing violent conflicts between communities
- Promoting sustainable utilization of limited resources
- Creating economic opportunities through enhanced communication
- Building resilience against climate variability
- Preserving traditional livelihoods while embracing technological innovation
